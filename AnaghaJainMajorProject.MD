Using the pokemon dataset, I have implemented algorithms - KNN and Logistic Regression for image classification.

The conclusion of this project being as follows:
The Logistic Regression has an accuracy of 0.97368 while the KNN Algorithm has an accuracy of 0.77631.
This shows that Logistic Regression is a better algorithm than KNN for this particular problem of image classification.
