The questions are done in the following order: (as per given in the pdf)
1. Determine the maximum no. of followers possessed by a user belonging to the group of users with no profile picture.
2. Dead accounts are characterized by a lack of substantial activity on the platform, primarily concerning the accounts with no profile picture, empty bio and 0 posts.
Determine the number of dead accounts, if they exist.
3. Find out how expressive a person is on Instagram based on the length of their bio.
(Hint: An expressive person can be defined as the user whose description_length exceeds the average.)
4. Determine the maximum no. of followers possessed by a user among those who have 0 posts on their respective accounts.
5. Fake accounts have been witnessed to heavily skew the follower and following numbers.
